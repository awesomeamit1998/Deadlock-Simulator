# Deadlock-Simulator
Its a simulation of  of deadlock of sytems in a company where there are multiple resources available such as printers,tapedrive,fax machine and more.

If there is a request made by company employees then the system administrator checks for the availability by giving the request of each resource required by employee as input and  checks whether there is availabity of resources through the software

If there is no possibilty for allocating the resources then the system is deemed to be in deadlock state.
